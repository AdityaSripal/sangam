# Sangam Etymology

1. The past couple years of meditation practice has made me deeply appreciative of the importance of a community, or sangha, that can support one another on an intensely individual journey. I see Sangam in a similar light. Each creator uses Sangam to fulfill an individual journey and the Sangam community exists to support and nourish them on the way.

2. The tamil sangams were ancient, (probably mythical) assemblies of poets, scholars, and artists that would share their creations with one another. This idea has always appealed to me, regardless of the historicity of the original sangams, I believe a modern one can be built.

The etymology of the word Sangam is obviously connected to my own personal background. 
I'm open to a new word that is more detached from my personal identity and has less cultural/religious affiliation. 
For now it works as a good name in my opinion.
